                <h2 style="font-style: italic;">I wash my hands of your lawsuits</h2>
                <p>EFFECTIVE: June 4, 1994</p>
                <p>UPDATED: October 1, 2018 - Added GDPR Details</p>
                <p>INEFFECTIVE: Generally speaking</p>
                <p>Not for use in hot tubs. This website is meant for educational purposes only.
                    Any resemblance to real, artificial or simulated persons, living or dead, will be news to us. </p>

                <p>No currently living animals were harmed in the filming of this book. May arrive in pieces, some
                    assembly required.
                    Dead
                    batteries included. Use only as directed, and we direct you not to use it. No warranty expressed or
                    even gently
                    squeezed. Do not use while operating a motor vehicle or heavy equipment, which suggests a poor
                    future for
                    laptop-based digital content. Postage will be paid by addressee, and will she ever be surprised.
                    This is not an
                    offer
                    to sell securities, but we certainly hope that won't stop you. Apply only to affected area, but if
                    that looks
                    strange to you, you can apply it to the effected area, too. May be too intense for some viewers,
                    not intense enough
                    for others. Do not stamp, but if you must, stamp gently in your bare feet. Beware of low flying
                    aircraft, even if
                    we can't think of any practical thing to do if you happen to see some. Print or type, or have your
                    mother fill it
                    in. For recreational use only as we don't want you to think we're serious.</p>

                <p>Do not disturb us any further or they will let us out. All models swear they are over 18 years of
                    age. If condition
                    persists, consult your physician, he
                    needs the work. No user serviceable parts inside; we throw it away and start over. Freshest if
                    eaten before date on
                    carton, which doubles as an appetizer. Subject to change without official notice, or even
                    unofficial notice; we're
                    winging it. Times approximate after 23:59, Dec. 31, 1999. Simulated picture; your new TV should
                    look almost as
                    good. No postage necessary if hand delivered. Please remain seated until the captain replaces the
                    light in the
                    overhead sign. Breaking seal constitutes acceptance of agreement; we'll send a collection agent
                    over immediately.
                    For off-road use only; they'd be nuts to let these loose on the streets. As seen on TV, to the left
                    of the cable
                    box. One size fits all, poorly. Many suitcases look alike, though some look that way uniquely. 100%
                    virgin plastic,
                    and stop snickering. Contents may run if washed in hot water, may crawl if washed in cold water. We
                    have sent the
                    forms which your ex-spouse recommended. Slippery when wet, abrasive when dry. For office use only
                    (we write the
                    football pool numbers in that space). Drop in any mailbox and you'll find it cramped. Edited for
                    television by
                    inserting commercials every 10 minutes and chopping off the sides. Keep cool and dry; live on Mars.</p>

                <p>Post office will not deliver without postage, obstetricians will not deliver without payment. Return
                    to sender, no
                    forwarding
                    order on file, unable to forward -- keep it, we're sick of it. Not responsible for direct,
                    indirect, incidental or
                    consequential damages, though we do retain rights to any profits you might make. At participating
                    locations only,
                    if you can find them. Penalty for private use, which differs from general use. Follow all
                    directions on the label,
                    and yes, that means wake up at 2 a.m. and take another one. Substantial withdrawal for early
                    penalty. Do not write
                    below this line, and no coffee stains, either. Falling rock, the lesser Frank Lloyd Wright model
                    home. </p>

                <p>Lost ticket
                    pays maximum rate, which offers better odds than Lotto. Your canceled check is your receipt, fat
                    lot of good it
                    will do you. Place stamp here, not there. Avoid contact with skin: levitate. Sanitized for your
                    protection using
                    portable autoclaves. Be sure each item is properly endorsed by a major political party. Your
                    signature is not an
                    admission of guilt, though we'll try and convince the jury otherwise. Slightly higher west of the
                    Mississippi, much
                    higher west of Texas, practically below sea level in Florida. Employees, their families, and any
                    others who might
                    actually care are not eligible. Beware of dog poop. Limited time offer, operators are standing by
                    waiting for their
                    chairs to be delivered.</p>

                <p>You must be present to win, and you must win to be invited. No passes accepted for this engagement,
                    but the
                    elopement is free. No purchase necessary means it is necessary not to purchase. Processed at
                    URL stamped in code at top of carton. Use only in a well-ventilated area near an emergency room.
                    Keep away from
                    fire or flames or nuclear detonations. Replace with same PostScript type. Look for the union label;
                    it shows the
                    best workmanship. Your contribution may be tax deductible if they don't audit. Some equipment shown
                    is optional,
                    some hasn't even been manufactured, many pieces are plastic simulations. Price does not include
                    tax, title,
                    shipping or content. No Canadian coins except those nifty gold dollars. Not recommended for
                    children of taste.
                    Prerecorded for this time zone by beings from the future. </p>

                <p>Reproduction strictly prohibited, yet it hasn't prevented population growth. No alcohol, dogs,
                    children or loud
                    shirts. No anchovies that you'll ever be able to detect.
                    Specially packaged for this restaurant by someone with a bottling plant. Absolutely no one will be
                    admitted after
                    start of show if all the seats are filled. Call this toll free number before you dig a hole and
                    trigger a regional
                    blackout. Driver does not carry cash so loan him a quarter if he runs out of gas. Objects in mirror
                    may be closer
                    than they appear, and have big teeth, too. Do not fend, mold, bindle or sputilate. No transfers
                    issued if the
                    server on the other end is busy. Package sold by weight, not by wait. </p>

                <p>Your mileage may vary if you drive to different places. If any part of this agreement is held to be
                    unenforceable,
                    we'll keep printing it, anyway, since
                    you probably won't find out. Conflicts may have settled during strike. Void where prohibited,
                    taxed, or when your
                    bladder is full. If you do not accept the terms of this agreement you've just wasted several
                    minutes.</p>

                    This website was made by me (Thomas). I did so by taking some <a href="mozilla website" alt="Mozilla's learning website.">
                        online courses</a> through
                    Mozilla Firefox's delightful developer site.
                    I also looked through some templates from <a href="bootstrap templates" alt="
                                bootstrap templates website">Bootstrap
                        Templates.</a> The code relies on some of their design concepts, but was all written from scratch by me (<em>i.e.</em> not from a template).
