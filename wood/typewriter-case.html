                    I got a 1925 Remington Typewriter as part of a shtick for Burning Man. 
                    (I was a newspaper reporter, with a satirical page à la Onion, and filled in people's personal stories with the typewriter as I met folks walking around.)
                    Practically speaking, I needed to be able to carry the thing around for several hours at a time. And despite being marketed as a "portable" version
                    (true, relatively speaking, compared to the other behemoth models available at the time), it was still quite heavy. More importantly, the machine's original 
                    case was worn out, the handle was broken, and it would have let in all kinds of dust and grime. It's also fairly fragile, so risked damage without a new case.
                </p>
                <img src="../images/typewriter5.jpg" style="width: 100%;">
                <p>
                    As you can see, I went for the classic briefcase look. The design is fairly simple, although there were a few constraints that made thinking through the 
                    design a bit tricky. For one, it needs to be easily accessible. It needs to allow the carriage (the cylindrical thing that moves the paper as you type)
                    to travel freely without bumping into wooden edges. It also needs to allow the hands easy access to the keyboard. The original case actually came apart 
                    into two pieces when being used, but I preferred to have a hinged version that would keep the edges neatly aligned at all times. Finally, I was going to be
                    lugging this thing around Black Rock City, a place with dust that is notoriously alkaline and thus bad for metals of all kinds. So I wanted to be sure that the 
                    case closed very firmly, keeping the machine as clean as possible. 
                </p>
                <p>
                        I decided to have the top be a box with five sides, with the bottom a hinged addition that would complete the prism and enclose the typewriter. So that 
                        it would close easily, the top part lays down snug on top of the square base, rather than fitting <em>around</em> a square base. The top had four 
                        sides (two longer, two shorter) attached to a small square with wood screws. Screws rather than glue because the whole thing was fairly heavy, and strength
                        was important. 
                        </p>

                <p>
                    As you can see above, the typewriter was attached to its original case with screws, and padded with rubber washers. I basically did the same thing. 
                    I found rubber washers of various sizes at the hardware store, along with metal washers larger than the size of the holes so that it would be as snug 
                    as possible. (This is vague, sorry - more detail later.) Basically, on top of the base, I sandwiched rubber washer, typewriter, rubber washer, metal 
                    washer, then screw. Using multiple levels of rubber washers keeps the paint of the machine from being chipped by the metal washer. 
                </p>
                <p>
                    The next touch was a thin layer of scrap wood nailed into the base so that when the top closed, there would be a lip at the crack that 
                    formed a barrier against dust or other debris. I also laid a thin strip of foam where the top would meet the bottom, so that it would close 
                    gently and form a further seal. 
                </p>
                <p>Hinges, handle, latches, and the brass corner decorations were all actually quite easy - they're all sold in the same aisle of the hardware store, 
                    so it's just a matter of buying them and screwing/nailing them in. I was especially happy to find the corner decorations. They were the difference
                    between it looking like a quite amateur project and something somewhat more refined.

                This website was made by me. I did so by taking some <a href="mozilla website" alt="Mozilla's learning website.">
                    online courses</a> through
                Mozilla Firefox's delightful website.
                I also looked through some templates from <a href="bootstrap templates" alt="
                            bootstrap templates website">Bootstrap
                    Templates</a> and <a href="the holy grail" alt="A website design blog.">The Holy Grail</a> (a real
                site, I
                know) to see
                how real live websites were made in the real live world. I borrowed some of
                their ideas.
