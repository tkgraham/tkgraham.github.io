                <h1>A Speech, or Four</h1>
                <h2><span id="gettysburg-address"  class="toc-anchor"></span>Ye Olde Gettysburgge Addresse</h2>
                <p>Four score and seven years ago our fathers brought forth on this continent, a new nation, conceived
                    in Liberty, and dedicated to the proposition that all men are created equal.<br>

                    <br>Now we are engaged in a great civil war, testing whether that nation, or any nation so
                    conceived and so dedicated, can long endure. We are met on a great battle-field of that war. We
                    have come to dedicate a portion of that field, as a final resting place for those who here gave
                    their lives that that nation might live. It is altogether fitting and proper that we should do
                    this.<br>

                    <br>But, in a larger sense, we can not dedicate -- we can not consecrate -- we can not hallow --
                    this ground. The brave men, living and dead, who struggled here, have consecrated it, far above our
                    poor power to add or detract. The world will little note, nor long remember what we say here, but
                    it can never forget what they did here. It is for us the living, rather, to be dedicated here to
                    the unfinished work which they who fought here have thus far so nobly advanced. It is rather for us
                    to be here dedicated to the great task remaining before us -- that from these honored dead we take
                    increased devotion to that cause for which they gave the last full measure of devotion -- that we
                    here highly resolve that these dead shall not have died in vain -- that this nation, under God,
                    shall have a new birth of freedom -- and that government of the people, by the people, for the
                    people, shall not perish from the earth.</p>

                <h2><span id="duty-honor-country"  class="toc-anchor"></span>Duty, Honor, Country</h2>

                <p>General Westmoreland, General Grove, distinguished guests, and gentlemen of the Corps!

                    <br><br>As I was leaving the hotel this morning, a doorman asked me, "Where are you bound for,
                    General?" And when I replied, "West Point," he remarked, "Beautiful place. Have you ever been there
                    before?"

                    <br><br> No human being could fail to be deeply moved by such a tribute as this [Thayer Award].
                    Coming from a profession I have served so long, and a people I have loved so well, it fills me with
                    an emotion I cannot express. But this award is not intended primarily to honor a personality, but
                    to symbolize a great moral code -- the code of conduct and chivalry of those who guard this beloved
                    land of culture and ancient descent. That is the animation of this medallion. For all eyes and for
                    all time, it is an expression of the ethics of the American soldier. That I should be integrated in
                    this way with so noble an ideal arouses a sense of pride and yet of humility which will be with me
                    always

                    <br><br> Duty, Honor, Country: Those three hallowed words reverently dictate what you ought to be,
                    what you can be, what you will be. They are your rallying points: to build courage when courage
                    seems to fail; to regain faith when there seems to be little cause for faith; to create hope when
                    hope becomes forlorn.

                    <br><br> Unhappily, I possess neither that eloquence of diction, that poetry of imagination, nor
                    that brilliance of metaphor to tell you all that they mean.

                    <br> <br> The unbelievers will say they are but words, but a slogan, but a flamboyant phrase. Every
                    pedant, every demagogue, every cynic, every hypocrite, every troublemaker, and I am sorry to say,
                    some others of an entirely different character, will try to downgrade them even to the extent of
                    mockery and ridicule.

                    <br><br> But these are some of the things they do: They build your basic character. They mold you
                    for your future roles as the custodians of the nation's defense. They make you strong enough to
                    know when you are weak, and brave enough to face yourself when you are afraid. They teach you to be
                    proud and unbending in honest failure, but humble and gentle in success; not to substitute words
                    for actions, not to seek the path of comfort, but to face the stress and spur of difficulty and
                    challenge; to learn to stand up in the storm but to have compassion on those who fall; to master
                    yourself before you seek to master others; to have a heart that is clean, a goal that is high; to
                    learn to laugh, yet never forget how to weep; to reach into the future yet never neglect the past;
                    to be serious yet never to take yourself too seriously; to be modest so that you will remember the
                    simplicity of true greatness, the open mind of true wisdom, the meekness of true strength. They
                    give you a temper of the will, a quality of the imagination, a vigor of the emotions, a freshness
                    of the deep springs of life, a temperamental predominance of courage over timidity, of an appetite
                    for adventure over love of ease. They create in your heart the sense of wonder, the unfailing hope
                    of what next, and the joy and inspiration of life. They teach you in this way to be an officer and
                    a gentleman.

                    <br><br> And what sort of soldiers are those you are to lead? Are they reliable? Are they brave?
                    Are they capable of victory? Their story is known to all of you. It is the story of the American
                    man-at-arms. My estimate of him was formed on the battlefield many, many years ago, and has never
                    changed. I regarded him then as I regard him now -- as one of the world's noblest figures, not only
                    as one of the finest military characters, but also as one of the most stainless. His name and fame
                    are the birthright of every American citizen. In his youth and strength, his love and loyalty, he
                    gave all that mortality can give.

                    <br> <br> He needs no eulogy from me or from any other man. He has written his own history and
                    written it in red on his enemy's breast. But when I think of his patience under adversity, of his
                    courage under fire, and of his modesty in victory, I am filled with an emotion of admiration I
                    cannot put into words. He belongs to history as furnishing one of the greatest examples of
                    successful patriotism. He belongs to posterity as the instructor of future generations in the
                    principles of liberty and freedom. He belongs to the present, to us, by his virtues and by his
                    achievements. In 20 campaigns, on a hundred battlefields, around a thousand campfires, I have
                    witnessed that enduring fortitude, that patriotic self-abnegation, and that invincible
                    determination which have carved his statue in the hearts of his people. From one end of the world
                    to the other he has drained deep the chalice of courage.

                    <br><br> As I listened to those songs [of the glee club], in memory's eye I could see those
                    staggering columns of the First World War, bending under soggy packs, on many a weary march from
                    dripping dusk to drizzling dawn, slogging ankle-deep through the mire of shell-shocked roads, to
                    form grimly for the attack, blue-lipped, covered with sludge and mud, chilled by the wind and rain,
                    driving home to their objective, and for many, to the judgment seat of God.

                    <br> <br> I do not know the dignity of their birth, but I do know the glory of their death. They
                    died unquestioning, uncomplaining, with faith in their hearts, and on their lips the hope that we
                    would go on to victory. Always, for them: Duty, Honor, Country; always their blood and sweat and
                    tears, as we sought the way and the light and the truth.

                    <br> <br> And 20 years after, on the other side of the globe, again the filth of murky foxholes,
                    the stench of ghostly trenches, the slime of dripping dugouts; those boiling suns of relentless
                    heat, those torrential rains of devastating storms; the loneliness and utter desolation of jungle
                    trails; the bitterness of long separation from those they loved and cherished; the deadly
                    pestilence of tropical disease; the horror of stricken areas of war; their resolute and determined
                    defense, their swift and sure attack, their indomitable purpose, their complete and decisive
                    victory -- always victory. Always through the bloody haze of their last reverberating shot, the
                    vision of gaunt, ghastly men reverently following your password of: Duty, Honor, Country.

                    <br><br> The code which those words perpetuate embraces the highest moral laws and will stand the
                    test of any ethics or philosophies ever promulgated for the uplift of mankind. Its requirements are
                    for the things that are right, and its restraints are from the things that are wrong.

                    <br> <br>The soldier, above all other men, is required to practice the greatest act of religious
                    training -- sacrifice.

                    <br> <br> In battle and in the face of danger and death, he discloses those divine attributes which
                    his Maker gave when he created man in his own image. No physical courage and no brute instinct can
                    take the place of the Divine help which alone can sustain him.

                    <br> <br> However horrible the incidents of war may be, the soldier who is called upon to offer and
                    to give his life for his country is the noblest development of mankind.

                    <br> <br> You now face a new world -- a world of change. The thrust into outer space of the
                    satellite, spheres, and missiles mark the beginning of another epoch in the long story of mankind.
                    In the five or more billions of years the scientists tell us it has taken to form the earth, in the
                    three or more billion years of development of the human race, there has never been a more abrupt or
                    staggering evolution. We deal now not with things of this world alone, but with the illimitable
                    distances and as yet unfathomed mysteries of the universe. We are reaching out for a new and
                    boundless frontier.

                    <br> <br>We speak in strange terms: of harnessing the cosmic energy; of making winds and tides work
                    for us; of creating unheard synthetic materials to supplement or even replace our old standard
                    basics; to purify sea water for our drink; of mining ocean floors for new fields of wealth and
                    food; of disease preventatives to expand life into the hundreds of years; of controlling the
                    weather for a more equitable distribution of heat and cold, of rain and shine; of space ships to
                    the moon; of the primary target in war, no longer limited to the armed forces of an enemy, but
                    instead to include his civil populations; of ultimate conflict between a united human race and the
                    sinister forces of some other planetary galaxy; of such dreams and fantasies as to make life the
                    most exciting of all time.

                    <br> <br> And through all this welter of change and development, your mission remains fixed,
                    determined, inviolable: it is to win our wars.

                    <br> <br> Everything else in your professional career is but corollary to this vital dedication.
                    All other public purposes, all other public projects, all other public needs, great or small, will
                    find others for their accomplishment. But you are the ones who are trained to fight. Yours is the
                    profession of arms, the will to win, the sure knowledge that in war there is no substitute for
                    victory; that if you lose, the nation will be destroyed; that the very obsession of your public
                    service must be: Duty, Honor, Country.

                    <br> <br> Others will debate the controversial issues, national and international, which divide
                    men's minds; but serene, calm, aloof, you stand as the Nation's war-guardian, as its lifeguard from
                    the raging tides of international conflict, as its gladiator in the arena of battle. For a century
                    and a half you have defended, guarded, and protected its hallowed traditions of liberty and
                    freedom, of right and justice.

                    <br><br> Let civilian voices argue the merits or demerits of our processes of government; whether
                    our strength is being sapped by deficit financing, indulged in too long, by federal paternalism
                    grown too mighty, by power groups grown too arrogant, by politics grown too corrupt, by crime grown
                    too rampant, by morals grown too low, by taxes grown too high, by extremists grown too violent;
                    whether our personal liberties are as thorough and complete as they should be. These great national
                    problems are not for your professional participation or military solution. Your guidepost stands
                    out like a ten-fold beacon in the night: Duty, Honor, Country.

                    <br> <br>You are the leaven which binds together the entire fabric of our national system of
                    defense. From your ranks come the great captains who hold the nation's destiny in their hands the
                    moment the war tocsin sounds. The Long Gray Line has never failed us. Were you to do so, a million
                    ghosts in olive drab, in brown khaki, in blue and gray, would rise from their white crosses
                    thundering those magic words: Duty, Honor, Country.

                    <br><br> This does not mean that you are war mongers.

                    <br><br>On the contrary, the soldier, above all other people, prays for peace, for he must suffer
                    and bear the deepest wounds and scars of war.

                    <br><br>But always in our ears ring the ominous words of Plato, that wisest of all philosophers:
                    "Only the dead have seen the end of war."1

                    <br><br>The shadows are lengthening for me. The twilight is here. My days of old have vanished,
                    tone and tint. They have gone glimmering through the dreams of things that were. Their memory is
                    one of wondrous beauty, watered by tears, and coaxed and caressed by the smiles of yesterday. I
                    listen vainly, but with thirsty ears, for the witching melody of faint bugles blowing reveille, of
                    far drums beating the long roll. In my dreams I hear again the crash of guns, the rattle of
                    musketry, the strange, mournful mutter of the battlefield.

                    <br><br> But in the evening of my memory, always I come back to West Point.

                    <br><br> Always there echoes and re-echoes: Duty, Honor, Country.

                    <br> <br> Today marks my final roll call with you, but I want you to know that when I cross the
                    river my last conscious thoughts will be of The Corps, and The Corps, and The Corps.

                    <br> <br> I bid you farewell.</p>

                <h2><span id="faulkner-nobel"  class="toc-anchor"></span>William Faulkner's Nobel Prize Acceptance Speech</h2>
                <p>Ladies and gentlemen,</p>
                <p>I feel that this award was not made to me as a man, but to my work &#8211; a life&#8217;s work in the agony and
                    sweat of the human spirit, not for glory and least of all for profit, but to create out of the materials of the
                    human spirit something which did not exist before. So this award is only mine in trust. It will not be difficult to
                    find a dedication for the money part of it commensurate with the purpose and significance of its origin. But I
                    would like to do the same with the acclaim too, by using this moment as a pinnacle from which I might be listened
                    to by the young men and women already dedicated to the same anguish and travail, among whom is already that one who
                    will some day stand here where I am standing.</p>
                <p> Our tragedy today is a general and universal physical fear so long sustained by now that we can even bear it. There
                    are no longer problems of the spirit. There is only the question: When will I be blown up? Because of this, the
                    young man or woman writing today has forgotten the problems of the human heart in conflict with itself which alone
                    can make good writing because only that is worth writing about, worth the agony and the sweat.</p>
                <p> He must learn them again. He must teach himself that the basest of all things is to be afraid; and, teaching
                    himself that, forget it forever, leaving no room in his workshop for anything but the old verities and truths of
                    the heart, the old universal truths lacking which any story is ephemeral and doomed &#8211; love and honor and pity
                    and pride and compassion and sacrifice. Until he does so, he labors under a curse. He writes not of love but of
                    lust, of defeats in which nobody loses anything of value, of victories without hope and, worst of all, without pity
                    or compassion. His griefs grieve on no universal bones, leaving no scars. He writes not of the heart but of the
                    glands.</p>
                <p> Until he relearns these things, he will write as though he stood among and watched the end of man. I decline to
                    accept the end of man. It is easy enough to say that man is immortal simply because he will endure: that when the
                    last dingdong of doom has clanged and faded from the last worthless rock hanging tideless in the last red and dying
                    evening, that even then there will still be one more sound: that of his puny inexhaustible voice, still talking.</p>
                <p>I refuse to accept this. I believe that man will not merely endure: he will prevail. He is immortal, not because he
                    alone among creatures has an inexhaustible voice, but because he has a soul, a spirit capable of compassion and
                    sacrifice and endurance. The poet&#8217;s, the writer&#8217;s, duty is to write about these things. It is his
                    privilege to help man endure by lifting his heart, by reminding him of the courage and honor and hope and pride and
                    compassion and pity and sacrifice which have been the glory of his past. The poet&#8217;s voice need not merely be
                    the record of man, it can be one of the props, the pillars to help him endure and prevail.</p>
                    
                <h2><span id="i-have-a-dream"  class="toc-anchor"></span>I Have a Dream</h2>
                <p>Five score years ago, a great American, in whose symbolic shadow we stand today, signed the Emancipation
                    Proclamation. This momentous decree came as a great beacon light of hope to millions of Negro slaves who had been
                    seared in the flames of withering injustice. It came as a joyous daybreak to end the long night of their captivity.</p>
                <p>But one hundred years later, the Negro still is not free; one hundred years later, the life of the Negro is still
                    sadly crippled by the manacles of segregation and the chains of discrimination; one hundred years later, the Negro
                    lives on a lonely island of poverty in the midst of a vast ocean of material prosperity; one hundred years later,
                    the Negro is still languished in the corners of American society and finds himself in exile in his own land.</p>
                <p>So we’ve come here today to dramatize a shameful condition. In a sense we’ve come to our nation’s capital to cash a
                    check. When the architects of our republic wrote the magnificent words of the Constitution and the Declaration of
                    Independence, they were signing a promissory note to which every American was to fall heir. This note was the
                    promise that all men, yes, black men as well as white men, would be guaranteed the unalienable rights of life,
                    liberty, and the pursuit of happiness.</p>
                <p>It is obvious today that America has defaulted on this promissory note in so far as her citizens of color are
                    concerned. Instead of honoring this sacred obligation, America has given the Negro people a bad check, a check
                    which has come back marked “insufficient funds.” But we refuse to believe that the bank of justice is bankrupt. We
                    refuse to believe that there are insufficient funds in the great vaults of opportunity of this nation. And so we
                    have come to cash this check, a check that will give us upon demand the riches of freedom and the security of
                    justice.</p>
                <p>We have also come to this hallowed spot to remind America of the fierce urgency of now. This is no time to engage in
                    the luxury of cooling off or to take the tranquilizing drug of gradualism. Now is the time to make real the
                    promises of democracy; now is the time to rise from the dark and desolate valley of segregation to the sunlit path
                    of racial justice; now is the time to lift our nation from the quicksands of racial injustice to the solid rock of
                    brotherhood; now is the time to make justice a reality for all of God’s children. It would be fatal for the nation
                    to overlook the urgency of the moment. This sweltering summer of the Negro’s legitimate discontent will not pass
                    until there is an invigorating autumn of freedom and equality. Nineteen sixty-three is not an end, but a beginning.
                    And those who hope that the Negro needed to blow off steam and will now be content, will have a rude awakening if
                    the nation returns to business as usual. There will be neither rest nor tranquility in America until the Negro is
                    granted his citizenship rights. The whirlwinds of revolt will continue to shake the foundations of our nation until
                    the bright day of justice emerges.</p>
                <p>But there is something that I must say to my people, who stand on the worn threshold which leads into the palace of
                    justice. In the process of gaining our rightful place, we must not be guilty of wrongful deeds. Let us not seek to
                    satisfy our thirst for freedom by drinking from the cup of bitterness and hatred. We must forever conduct our
                    struggle on the high plane of dignity and discipline. We must not allow our creative protests to degenerate into
                    physical violence. Again and again we must rise to the majestic heights of meeting physical force with soul force.
                    The marvelous new militancy, which has engulfed the Negro community, must not lead us to a distrust of all white
                    people. For many of our white brothers, as evidenced by their presence here today, have come to realize that their
                    destiny is tied up with our destiny. And they have come to realize that their freedom is inextricably bound to our
                    freedom. We cannot walk alone. And as we walk, we must make the pledge that we shall always march ahead. We cannot
                    turn back.</p>
                <p>There are those who are asking the devotees of Civil Rights, “When will you be satisfied?” We can never be satisfied
                    as long as the Negro is the victim of the unspeakable horrors of police brutality; we can never be satisfied as
                    long as our bodies, heavy with the fatigue of travel, cannot gain lodging in the motels of the highways and the
                    hotels of the cities; we cannot be satisfied as long as the Negro’s basic mobility is from a smaller ghetto to a
                    larger one; we can never be satisfied as long as our children are stripped of their selfhood and robbed of their
                    dignity by signs stating “For Whites Only”; we cannot be satisfied as long as the Negro in Mississippi cannot vote,
                    and the Negro in New York believes he has nothing for which to vote. No! no, we are not satisfied, and we will not
                    be satisfied until “justice rolls down like waters and righteousness like a mighty stream.”</p>
                <p>I am not unmindful that some of you have come here out of great trials and tribulations.  Some of you have come
                    fresh from narrow jail cells. Some of you have come from areas where your quest for freedom left you battered by
                    the storms of persecution and staggered by the winds of police brutality. You have been the veterans of creative
                    suffering. Continue to work with the faith that unearned suffering is redemptive. Go back to Mississippi. Go back
                    to Alabama. Go back to South Carolina. Go back to Georgia. Go back to Louisiana. Go back to the slums and ghettos
                    of our Northern cities, knowing that somehow this situation can and will be changed.  Let us not wallow in the
                    valley of despair.</p>
                <p>I say to you today, my friends, so even though we face the difficulties of today and tomorrow, I still have a
                    dream. It is a dream deeply rooted in the American dream. I have a dream that one day this nation will rise up and
                    live out the true meaning of its creed, “We hold these truths to be self-evident, that all men are created
                    equal.” I have a dream that one day on the red hills of Georgia, sons of former slaves and the sons of former
                    slaveowners will be able to sit down together at the table of brotherhood. I have a dream that one day even the
                    state of Mississippi, a state sweltering with the heat of injustice, sweltering with the heat of oppression, will
                    be transformed into an oasis of freedom and justice. I have a dream that my four little children will one day live
                    in a nation where they will not be judged by the color of their skin but by the content of their character.</p>
                <p>I HAVE A DREAM TODAY!</p>
                <p>I have a dream that one day down in Alabama — with its vicious racists, with its Governor having his lips dripping
                    with the words of interposition and nullification — one day right there in Alabama, little black boys and black
                    girls will be able to join hands with little white boys and white girls as sisters and brothers.</p>
                <p>I HAVE A DREAM TODAY!</p>
                <p>I have a dream that one day every valley shall be exalted, and every hill and mountain shall be made low. The rough
                    places will be plain and the crooked places will be made straight, “and the glory of the Lord shall be revealed,
                    and all flesh shall see it together.”</p>
                <p>This is our hope. This is the faith that I go back to the South with. With this faith we will be able to hew out of
                    the mountain of despair a stone of hope.  With this faith we will be able to transform the jangling discords of our
                    nation into a beautiful symphony of brother-hood. With this faith we will be able to work together, to pray
                    together, to struggle together, to go to jail together, to stand up for freedom together, knowing that we will be
                    free one day.  And this will be the day. This will be the day when all of God’s children will be able to sing with
                    new meaning, “My country ’tis of thee, sweet land of liberty, of thee I sing. Land where my father died, land of
                    the pilgrim’s pride, from every mountainside, let freedom ring.” And if America is to be a great nation, this must
                    become true.</p>
                <p>So let freedom ring from the prodigious hilltops of New Hampshire; let freedom ring from the mighty mountains of New
                    York; let freedom ring from the heightening Alleghenies of Pennsylvania; let freedom ring from the snow-capped
                    Rockies of Colorado; let freedom ring from the curvaceous slopes of California. But not only that. Let freedom ring
                    from Stone Mountain of Georgia; let freedom ring from Lookout Mountain of Tennessee; let freedom ring from every
                    hill and mole hill of Mississippi. “From every mountainside, let freedom ring.”</p>
                <p>And when this happens, and when we allow freedom to ring, when we let it ring from every village and every hamlet,
                    from every state and every city, we will be able to speed up that day when all of God’s children, black men and
                    white men, Jews and Gentiles, Protestants and Catholics, will be able to join hands and sing in the words of the
                    old Negro spiritual: “Free at last. Free at last. Thank God Almighty, we are free at last.”</p>
