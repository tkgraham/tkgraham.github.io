                <h1>Internet 101: Infrastructure and Security</h1>
                <p><em>I wrote this article for a tech website called www.techjunkie.com when I was working as a freelance
                    writer on UpWork. It answers the question "what happens when I click a url"?
                </em></p>
                <p>
                    The internet is all around us, figuratively and literally. It is talked about all the time—in news,
                    business, and popular culture—and impacts a huge number of our daily interactions. However, most people
                    do not understand the different pieces that comprise this complex global infrastructure, nor how they
                    interact with one another. The fact that we can (almost) instantly send emails from Nebraska to Japan,
                    and have those emails beautifully render in a well-designed app on our smartphones can be too easily
                    taken for granted in the 21st century.
                </p>
                <p>
                    This article probes into some of the basic functionality of the internet, and hopes to answer questions
                    that may at first seem too obvious to ask: What is the internet? What happens when I connect to it? Is
                    my data really secure, and if so, how does that work? We won’t get all the way into the 1s and 0s, but
                    after reading, you should be able to impress your friends with your knowledge of these fundamental
                    concepts.
                </p>
                <p>
                    What is the internet? The internet (read: Interconnected Network) is often discussed as if there is one
                    single repository of information that your devices tap into when you log in to email or search for a
                    nice brownie recipe. This is not the case. Rather, it is a global network of interconnected devices,
                    each of which has the ability to send and receive information.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Consider first a small group of computers, like might exist within an office or apartment complex. If
                    these computers are linked together, they form a network that can allow each to access the information
                    housed on the other machines. Why have several devices rather than just one, super-powerful device? For
                    one, this setup allows for many users to create and access information simultaneously. This boosts
                    their potential work output many-fold. It also allows the various components of a network to each
                    specialize in a particular function. Some devices may have more information-storing capacity while
                    others may host special applications that the others cannot run. Some might be designed for human
                    interaction (i.e. have a keyboard, mouse, and screen) while others (like servers, specialized devices
                    or programs which provide functionality to other devices) may only do computation and retrieve
                    information. The ability to share information quickly among a multitude of diverse, specialized devices
                    is, at its core, the power of the internet
                </p>
                <p>
                    Now, imagine that there are several of these small networks in a cluster—if the network mentioned above
                    is a neighborhood, then this cluster of networks is like a city. The analogy can be expanded many-fold,
                    with states, countries, and even continents worth of networks and devices. The global internet is a
                    multi-tiered network of networks. In the real world, many of these individual networks specialize in
                    providing a service to other users who access that network. YouTube, for example, stores lots of videos
                    at warehouse-like data centers, vast repositories of information, which can then be accessed by users
                    like you. Facebook’s servers constantly update information about the profiles of all their members,
                    analyzing and repackaging it in order to engage users. It is a constantly expanding web of information
                    providers (servers) and retrievers (clients).
                </p>
                <p>
                    Internet Service Providers: But, you may be wondering, how is this information actually exchanged? How
                    does my status update make it to Facebook and then to my friend’s timeline? This is where your Internet
                    Service Provider (ISP, from here on out) comes in. They don’t own the information on the internet, but
                    control the cables through which our data flows. In the networks-are-cities analogy above, ISPs pave
                    and maintain the highways. Your monthly payment to Comcast, AT&T, Time Warner Cable, or any of the
                    hundreds of other ISPs around the world, provides you access to the physical infrastructure that links
                    all the other internet-enabled devices in the world. This global network of high-speed cables is
                    capable of transmitting terabytes (thousands of gigabytes) of data per second at nearly the speed of
                    light. Not a bad deal, eh?
                </p>
                <p>
                    (Possibly delete this paragraph.) The economics of the ISP are an interesting corollary to our
                    discussion of the internet. If you subscribe to a small, regional ISP, then the fact that they can
                    connect you to computers anywhere in the world may seem surprising. In fact, only a few of the largest,
                    so-called Tier 1 ISPs (Verizon, AT&T, Tata Communications in India, CenturyLink, etc.; there are only
                    ~15 Tier 1 ISPs) in the world can afford to lay transcontinental cables on the ocean floor. All of the
                    other small, local ISPs compete by building infrastructure in remote areas that the larger ISPs do not
                    want to invest in. They pay the Tier 1 companies for access to their global networks, while in turn
                    handling the data and requests of Tier 1 subscribers to computers in the region that their
                    infrastructure supports. Even Tier 1 ISPs tend not to have the infrastructure necessary to handle all
                    of the data that they are requested to transmit at any time, nor to reach all the destinations that
                    their customers request. To alleviate these issues, they ‘peer’ with other ISPs to pick up their
                    bandwidth or geographical slack. For example, Comcast might say to AT&T, “I have cables in Wyoming but
                    not Alaska. You have cables in Alaska, but not Wyoming. If you service all my customers in Alaska, I’ll
                    service all yours in Wyoming.” This allows all ISPs to provide the full suite of internet services to
                    their customers.
                </p>
                <p>
                    When I click a link or enter a URL into my address bar, what happens? So far, we have introduced the
                    major infrastructure of the internet: a global network of devices which store and retrieve information,
                    and the high-speed cables provided by ISPs that pass information among these devices. The next thing to
                    demystify is how this communication actually takes place.
                </p>

                    You are probably using an Internet Browser to read this article. It might be Safari, Chrome, Mozilla,
                    Internet Explorer, Opera, or one of many others. And you almost certainly clicked a link to reach the
                    article, or otherwise typed a URL (Unique Resource Locator) into your browser’s address bar in order to
                    reach it. Both of these activities are fundamental to retrieve information from the internet. Chances
                    are, you have opened a new web page dozens or even hundreds of times so far today. Your browser makes
                    the process of surfing the web seem very simple—it is, of course, designed to have this effect. But
                    what goes on beneath the hood is incredibly complex. People study it for years at university without
                    achieving a full understanding. Luckily, the basic events can be explained fairly quickly without
                    becoming lost in the nitty gritty. There are 4 basic steps, each a different protocol that your browser
                    executes:
                </p>
                <p>
                    1. DNS (Domain Name System), where your browser identifies where it can find a given website;
                </p>
                <p> 2. TCP (Transport Control Protocol), which establishes a connection between your computer and the
                    website’s server;
                </p>
                <p> 3. SSL/TLS (Secure Socket Layer/Transport Layer Security), an optional encryption step which we will
                    discuss in the next section; and
                </p>
                <p> 4. HTTP (Hypertext Transfer Protocol), by which the actual content of the website is shared.
                </p>
                <p>
                    When you enter a website URL like www.techjunkie.com, the first thing that your browser needs to do is
                    identify where on the internet that website can be found. Every URL has a unique IP (Internet Protocol)
                    address which, like your home address, encodes its location within the global internet. The fact that
                    we specify our internet destinations with textual URLs rather than numerical IP addresses is a
                    practical simplification. We humans cannot remember series of numbers as easily as we can catchy names
                    like Tech Junkie. Your computer, though, needs the website’s IP address in order to find it. Asking it
                    to visit www.techjunkie.com without the IP would be like asking you to find Sarah without providing any
                    information about what country she lives in.
                </p>
                <p>
                    There are several places where the IP address of your intended website may be referenced. Your browser
                    searches each of these in a hierarchical fashion until it it found, beginning with the easiest. If you
                    have visited your intended site recently (within the last half hour, say), the IP is likely still
                    stored in your browser’s cache. (Caches are common features of computer programs where frequently
                    referenced data is stored for quick access. Your browser has one, as does your computer’s operating
                    system.) If the IP is not cached, your browser will run a protocol called DNS (Domain Name System)
                    which relays the request to identify the IP out into the internet. It sends out a question—essentially,
                    “what is www.techjunkie.com”?—formatted according to the DNS protocol. The request will first go to
                    your router, which also has its own cache and may be able to return the correct IP address to you. If
                    not, then the request will be passed along by your router to your ISP’s DNS server, where they store
                    the names and IP addresses of millions of websites as a service to their customers.
                </p>
                <p>
                    If your ISP cannot identify a website, the request is passed along yet again to one of several Server
                    Managers whose job, among others, is to maintain registries websites on the internet. For example, a
                    company called Verisign holds and manages the routing information for all websites ending in .com and
                    .net. The Server Manager would answer your browser’s request, returning a block of information that
                    contains the desired IP. Without any webpage data having yet been exchanged, just locating a site’s IP
                    could involve relaying your request all over the world.
                </p>
                <p>
                    With the IP address now known, the next step is for your computer—which we will refer to as the
                    “client”—to set up a connection with the physical server where your website is hosted (read: where its
                    data is stored). This procedure is called TCP (Transmission Control Protocol), often referred to as the
                    “TCP Handshake.” You can think of it as the greeting which comes before a conversation.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Three introductory pieces of information are exchanged between client and server. The client first
                    sends one declaring its intent to communicate (‘syn’, for synchronize). The server then replies
                    indicating its availability to connect (‘syn-ack,’ for synchronize-acknowledge). Finally, the client
                    sends a third (‘ack’) to acknowledge receipt of the server’s reply. This process establishes a
                    connection. Each party then knows that the other exists, wants to communicate with them, is aware of
                    their location, and has agreed upon a format for exchanging information. This last feature—how the
                    information should be structured—is especially important given that not all browsers can support all
                    types of data or formatting.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Only after the browser has received the IP address through DNS and the client-server connection has
                    been established via the TCP handshake can the browser send specific information requests to the
                    server. These requests are formatted using HTTP, the Hypertext Transfer Protocol. Assuming that the
                    browser’s request is allowed by the server, it then returns a data stream in HTML (hypertext markup
                    language) to your browser describing the webpage that you are trying to visit. This includes textual
                    content as well as descriptions of format, color, style, and more. Your browser immediately begins to
                    interpret and render the HTML data into a webpage like this one as soon as it is received.
                </p>
                <p>
                    On the modern internet, it is likely that the HTML data being returned by the server will contain
                    references to other http:// links which must be retrieved in order to fully render the webpage. Some
                    examples of this are CSS styling libraries and JavaScript, which the browser needs to interpret complex
                    stylistic commands (fades, movement, layered content) or enable user interactivity. The page might also
                    include links to pictures or ad content. Accessing each of these other links, some of which may be
                    stored on other servers at different IP addresses, will initiate new IP retrieval via DNS, a new TCP
                    handshake, and new HTTP requests. Every connection goes through this process. For anything other than
                    bare bones websites, your browser is likely sending multiple requests and processing many incoming
                    streams of HTML data at any give time. Data may come back at different rates if your ISP is
                    experiencing high network traffic, or if one server is particularly slow to reach and respond. This is
                    why you may see the content on some complex webpages shuffle around as the data needed to render
                    various components is received. Even so, this whole process is remarkably fast. The information encoded
                    in this webpage likely traveled through thousands of miles of cables to reach you, all in less than the
                    amount of time it takes you to blink!
                </p>
                <p>
                    While your browser is performing a complicated task in managing data requests and rendering the
                    results, there is also a tremendous amount of complexity on the server side. High-traffic websites like
                    Facebook receive millions of individual HTTP requests every second, which can strain their servers if
                    data management and retrieval are not optimally implemented. Pages like Facebook’s also update in real
                    time, relying on a constant stream of back and forth HTTP requests and responses. Considering that
                    millions of Facebook users are in continuous contact with their server at any given time, they face
                    unprecedented engineering challenges associated with their scale. What may seem like tiny server-side
                    decisions—how often to refresh your timeline or suggest new friends—can have tremendous impact with
                    regard to data usage and the site’s overall responsiveness.
                </p>
                <p>
                    So far, everything we have discussed assumes that your computer is connecting to and receiving
                    information using the standard HTTP protocol. A crucial thing to understand about the internet is that
                    the ways you can interact with it from your browser are inherently limited. You can send and receive
                    requests and information, but, as a client, this is the limit of your control. You are trusting that
                    your information reaches its intended destination without being altered by a third party. You are also
                    trusting that the source of the information you receive is, in fact, the party you think you are
                    connecting to. This necessity to trust can put you in a position of vulnerability.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Internet Security: So, you may ask, how do I know that the information that I’m sending over the
                    internet isn’t being read by people I don’t intend? How do I know that I’m receiving information from
                    the source that I think? The short answer is encryption.
                </p>
                <p>
                    The original versions of the internet using HTTP faced a few major security risks. Anyone within a
                    network could perform a few kinds of basic hacks and see all the data being transmitted, including
                    passwords, banking information, or any other personal data that a user might not want to broadcast
                    publicly. Additionally, the data transmitted via unencrypted HTTP was not authenticatable. In other
                    words, senders could not be certain of the identity of their recipient, nor could they be sure of the
                    source of any data they received. This made users vulnerable to intercepted communications or
                    redirection to nefarious websites which might serve malware or other viruses.
                </p>
                <p>
                    As a response to these security issues of privacy and authenticity, researchers developed protocols for
                    establishing encrypted, verifiable connections between clients and servers. The first version of this
                    protocol was called SSL, Secure Sockets Layer. The current standard is a similar but improved protocol
                    called TLS, Transport Layer Security. A connection that has been established using TLS will have a
                    different prefix to its URL, https:// (for Hypertext Transfer Protocol Secure) rather than the standard
                    http://. Your browser is also conveniently designed to make you aware when it has established a secure
                    connection, like the one to this website. At the left side of your browser’s address bar, there will be
                    an image of a padlock, the word “secure,” or some combination of the two (the presentation varies by
                    browser). HTTPS is simply an exchange of HTTP requests and responses, as described above, but via a
                    connection that has been secured through TLS. But how does this process actually secure your
                    information? And how does the encryption work?
                </p>
                <p>
                    In the previous section, we discussed how your computer and a website’s server establish a connection
                    via a TCP handshake before exchanging HTTP requests. Secure connections execute the extra protocol,
                    TLS, between these steps. This essentially extends the handshake process with an exchange of additional
                    information related to identity and cryptography. The TLS handshake is intended to establish that the
                    two parties are who they claim to be, and defines how they will encrypt/decrypt the information they
                    exchange.
                </p>
                <p>
                    The encryption is done through a process called Public Key Cryptography. This is a dual
                    encryption-authentication system that relies on the parties each having two digital keys. One of the
                    keys is public, which the owner shares openly and disseminates to any other entity that requests it.
                    The other key is private, a secret which is shared with no one else. The keys are complimentary such
                    that a message encrypted with Bob’s private key can only be decoded with Bob’s public key, and vice
                    versa. No one without the unique key pair can decrypt the content—to any third party, the contents of
                    an encrypted message are meaningless gibberish. This scheme also provides a means to verify the
                    identity of an interlocutor. An encrypted message which can be successfully decrypted with Bob’s public
                    key can only have been sent by Bob. He holds the only matching pair.
                </p>
                <p>
                    As an example, if you are connecting securely to Facebook, then Facebook shares its public key with
                    you, and you share your public key with Facebook during the TLS handshake. When exchanging information,
                    your browser encrypts any messages that you send to Facebook with their public key and your private
                    key. Facebook then uses their private key and your public key to decrypt the message. This ensures that
                    you were the sender and that no middle man without their private key could have read or tampered with
                    it. In turn, any information that Facebook sends back to you is encrypted with their private key and
                    your public key, which your browser can then decrypt in the opposite way.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Practically speaking, Public Key Cryptography (also called Asymmetrical Cryptography, because the two
                    keys are different) is slow for computers to implement. Encrypting and decrypting the messages
                    asymmetrically requires complex math that consumes lots of your computer’s processing power. This is
                    not to mention the energy required of the server, which is potentially encrypting and decrypting
                    millions of messages at once. To avoid this problem, the client and server generally agree during the
                    TLS handshake on a computationally simpler “session key.” This is the same for both parties
                    (‘symmetrical cryptography’), requires less computationally intensive processing, and thereby speeds
                    communication. Your browser encrypts information with the key, and the server you are trying to reach
                    decodes the message with the same key. However, because the session key was determined using Public Key
                    Cryptography, the communication remains just as secure.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Beyond encryption, TLS also provides another service that is paramount to internet security: identity
                    verification. When a server shares its public key during the TLS handshake, it also sends a digital
                    certificate of authenticity attesting that it is, in fact, the real public key of www.facebook.com—the
                    multinational company incorporated in Menlo Park, CA. This certificate is crucial to ensure that you
                    are not accidentally establishing an encrypted connection with a malicious imposter who would then
                    solicit you for your Facebook username and password.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Digital certificates are “signed” by one of a number of trusted third party organizations called
                    Certificate Authorities. Essentially, the service they provide is trustworthiness. They vet businesses
                    and organizations who want to provide secure connections for their website’s users and then vouch for
                    their legitimacy. A website owner seeking a certificate will provide a Certificate Authority with
                    extensive real-world information about their organization, including addresses, corporate
                    documentation, and evidence that they own the website. The Certificate Authority will only issue them a
                    signed certificate them once being sufficiently convinced of their bone fides. Your browser comes with
                    a pre-installed list of trusted Certificate Authorities, which allows it to recognize certificates that
                    they endorse.
                </p>
                <p>
                    If you have established a secure connection and are browsing via HTTPS, you can click on the ‘lock’
                    icon in the address bar and view information about the certificate issued by the site you are currently
                    visiting. This will include at least the name of the issuing Certificate Authority, and may also
                    include the name of the website owner, its country of origin, server location, and other information.
                    Try it!
                </p>
                <p>
                    As a way to safeguard your security, most browsers will not move forward with a secure connection
                    unless it recognizes
                    the digital certificate signature. If you have spent much time surfing the web, it is likely that you
                    have encountered
                    a frightening error page from your browser informing you that “The site’s security certificate is not
                    trusted” (if you
                    are using Google Chrome), or “This connection is untrusted” (from Mozilla). These messages are meant to
                    inform you that
                    the browser cannot independently verify the identity or trustworthiness of the site you are trying to
                    visit. This may
                    simply be because your browser does not yet contain information about the signing Certificate
                    Authority, and the site
                    has no malicious intent.
                </p>
                <p>
                    However, your browser may be trying to steer you away from nefarious websites. Consider this scenario:
                    you try to visit
                    www.badidea.com and your browser makes a secure request to connect. Somehow, you are redirected to a
                    server that does
                    not actually belong to www.badidea.com. That fake server issues a certificate claiming that it is, in
                    fact,
                    www.badidea.com, and your browser displays the aforementioned warning. If you ignore this warning that
                    the certificate
                    is not trusted, you could end up sending private information to the server, or unintentionally
                    downloading viruses or
                    spyware. Especially if trying to connect to a site that you normally visit without a problem, it is
                    generally a good
                    idea to heed the browser’s warnings in situations such as this.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Again, stop and take a minute to appreciate how amazing it is that your computer can do all of these
                    things in the
                    blink of an eye when you type in a website and it connects securely: (1) request and receive the site’s
                    IP address via
                    DNS, (2) exchange three messages to establish a connection via TCP, (3) exchange and verify Public keys
                    and digital
                    certificates through TLS, (4) request and download megabytes of website content using HTTP, and (5)
                    potentially do this
                    many times over to render the site’s full content.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Also, feel free to appreciate that you now know what happens when you refresh your Facebook timeline,
                    or go to Tech
