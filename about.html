                    <h1>A Jack of Several Trades</h1>
                    <p style="font-family: 'Raleway', sans-serif">I aim to be the kind of guy your mother would love.
                        I am insatiably curious and enjoy learning, tinkering, and novelty in all their forms. On a
                        given day, you might find me
                        sprucing up my community house (see below), working on carpentry projects in our garage,
                        picking up new skills,
                        and generally absorbing as much as I can of what San Francisco has to offer. </p>
                    <p style="font-family: 'Raleway', sans-serif;">I identify as a reforming perfectionist. When taken
                        with an activity or task,
                        I have a tendency to disappear from public view for days on end whilst honing and refining my
                        practice of said
                        activity. This is how, for example, I came to spend the month of October in various cafes
                        making this <strike>admittdely
                            gorgeous

                        I am currently in search of gainful employ, after a few years at an immigration law firm and a
                        brief stint
                        as a freelance writer (see <a href="writing.html" alt="link to writing section" style="color: black;">here</a>). As
                        such, the most important thing for the
                        public to see (especially those ravishing individuals in hiring positions) is my resume. It is
                        conveniently embedded below, for such individuals to peruse. I'm trying to get my foot in the
                        door of the tech world,

                            Home for me is currently San Francisco, California. The foundation of my life there is a
                            30-member cooperative community house called
                            <a href="http://www.ubuntusf.org/" style="color: black;">Chateau Ubuntu,</a> where I have
                            lived since first coming to the city in January 2017.</a>
                            (The website is a bit out of date, but there
                            is some more recent content on our <a href="https://www.instagram.com/goodmorningubuntu/?hl=en"
                                style="color: black;">Instagram.</a>)</p>

                        <p style="font-family: 'Raleway', sans-serif">At first glance, this may look and sound a bit
                            extreme, some bizarre, hippy-ish manifestation of millennial stereotypes. We have certainly
                            been
                            <a href="https://www.sfgate.com/bayarea/article/SF-mansion-communal-living-chateau-ubuntu-8334337.php"
                                style="color: black;">accused of such.</a> In my experience, though, it has been
                            the best possible way to jump-start life after college. It's not the type of place where
                            you come home after work and watch TV. We cook, play music, and
                            <a href="wood.html" style="color: black;">build things together,</a> host events, take
                            collective responsibility of our home, and generally strive to be deeply involved in each
                            others' lives.
                            On any given evening, you might come home to find workshops, discussion groups, concerts,
                            parties, or at the very least, several folks sitting
                            <a href="https://www.instagram.com/p/BoZhLu0hQXH/?hl=en&taken-by=goodmorningubuntu" style="color: black;">around
                                our firepit.</a> The wealth of cooperative activities makes it only
                            natural that your housemates soon become your close friends.</p>
                        </p>
                        <p style="font-family: 'Raleway', sans-serif">
                            Communal living may not interest everyone, but I'm convinced that its opportunities for
                            learning are unending.
                            It forces you to consider how you want to live, how the systems around you shape your
                            day-to-day, how you interact with and are seen by others,
                            to handle conflict, to appreciate the efforts and quirks of your housemates, to support and
                            be supported.
                            Living here has allowed me to build close personal relationships that I never otherwise
                            would have, and enjoy
                            profound experiences at a rate I never thought possible. I wouldn't trade it for anything.

                        <p style="font-family: 'Raleway', sans-serif">
                            Before coming to San Francisco, I spent most of my life focused on competitive running. I
                            stopped seriously training and competing in 2015,
                            but before that it was the defining feature of my life from the 7th grade on. I met my best
                            friends through running, competed in races around the US, came west
                            in order to run at Stanford, and generally had a host of lovely experiences. </p>

                        <p style="font-family: 'Raleway', sans-serif">A few highlights along the way included:</p>

                        <ul style="font-family: 'Raleway', sans-serif;">
                            <li>Connecting with people around the country who shared a similar passion.</li>
                            <li>A fantastic community of supportive and down-to-earth runners in the Raleigh, NC area.</li>
                            <li>Getting to fully pursue my best with the support of family and friends.</li>
                            <li>Qualifying for the 2016 Olympic Trials by running 63:50 at the Houston Half Marathon.</li>
                            <li>Representing Team USA at the World Cross Country Champs in 2013.</li>
                            <li>Placing 2nd nationally in the 2-Mile as a Senior in HS.</li>
                            <li>Running the NC state record for the 5k (14:11), also as a Senior.</li>
                        </ul>

                        <p style="font-family: 'Raleway', sans-serif">Now I mostly run for fun, and have found a great
                            group of fellow runners in <a href="http://www.westvalleytc.com/" style="color: black;">
                                West Valley Track Club</a>, a competitive club team based in SF. Most recently, I did
                            the Burning Man 50K (see pic of dress below).</p>

                        <p style="font-family: 'Raleway', sans-serif">
                            As noted above, this site exists because I wanted to practice web design. As of this
                            writing, it
                            only involves HTML and CSS. I wanted to get a solid foundation in those before I started
                            adding JavaScript
                            interactivity. That will come soon. For now, it felt important to put something moderately
                            respectable
                            out on the interwebs rather than wait for perfection. </p>

                        <p style="font-family: 'Raleway', sans-serif">
                            I learned HTML and CSS primarily by using the developer tutorials that Mozilla Firefox
                            publishes. They're
                            very detailed, and place particular emphasis on development best practices. To get a sense
                            of design, I read some
                            articles, but mostly just looked at other sites that I liked and that I also expected would
                            have professional designers
                            on their payroll. Chances are, I figure, they know best.</p>

                        <p style="font-family: 'Raleway', sans-serif">A few features that I'm proud of are:</p>

                        <ul style="font-family: 'Raleway', sans-serif;">
                            <li>Responsive sizing and mobile-first design. It still looks sleek and doesn't overflow if
                                you open it on a phone.</li>
                            <li>A footer that is fixed to the bottom of the window, and becomes visible as you scroll
                                to the end of the main content.</li>
                            <li>Fade-in and fade-out animations on the various landing pages. Responsive links, too.

                    This website was made by me (Thomas). I did so by taking some <a href="mozilla website" alt="Mozilla's learning website.">
                        online courses</a> through
                    Mozilla Firefox's delightful developer site.
                    I also looked through some templates from <a href="bootstrap templates" alt="
                                bootstrap templates website">Bootstrap
                        Templates.</a> The code relies on some of their design concepts, but was all written from scratch by me (<em>i.e.</em> not from a template).
